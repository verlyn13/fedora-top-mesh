## Next Steps - Revised Multi-Phase Approach

Due to dnf5 challenges and successful 3-node deployment, implementation has evolved to **Phase 2-8 strategy**:

### Phase Evolution
- âœ… **Phase 1**: Network Foundation (100% complete)
- âœ… **Phase 2**: Configuration Management (operational on 2/3 nodes)
- ðŸ“‹ **Phase 2-8**: Comprehensive mesh-ops implementation

### Revised Implementation Order
1. **WSL2** (wsl-fedora-kbc): First target - handles corporate constraints
2. **This Laptop**: Second wave - stable testing platform  
3. **Hetzner**: Final deployment - maintains control node stability

**Phase 2.8 Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - All nodes have mesh-ops deployed!
**WSL2 Status**: âœ… mesh-ops operational at wsl-fedora-kbc (100.88.131.44)
**Laptop Status**: âœ… **mesh-ops COMPLETE** - deployment successful on 2025-09-07
**Hetzner Status**: âœ… mesh-ops deployed on 2025-09-08 (after SSH incident resolution)
**Final Achievement**: 3/3 nodes (100%) - Full mesh-ops coverage achieved!

## mesh-ops Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify mesh-ops user
id mesh-ops
# Expected: uid=2000(mesh-ops) gid=2000(mesh-ops) groups=2000(mesh-ops),10(wheel),190(systemd-journal),973(docker)

# Check home directory
ls -ld /home/mesh-ops
# Expected: drwx------. mesh-ops mesh-ops

# Test Tailscale access
sudo -u mesh-ops tailscale status
# Should show all 3 mesh nodes

# Test shell access
sudo -u mesh-ops bash -c 'echo "User: $USER on $(hostname)"'
# Expected: User: mesh-ops on fedora-top

# Original mesh verification (verlyn13 user)
tailscale status
tailscale ping hetzner-hq
./scripts/report-status.sh
```

## Hetzner SSH Incident Report (2025-09-08)

During the final Phase 2.8 deployment to Hetzner (Wave 3), an SSH configuration issue occurred that temporarily locked out administrative access. The incident was successfully resolved through console access and demonstrates the importance of:
- Phased rollout strategy (testing on WSL and laptop first)
- Maintaining emergency access methods (console access)
- Careful sudoers configuration validation

The mesh-ops user is now fully operational on all three nodes with appropriate security constraints.
