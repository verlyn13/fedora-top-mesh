# Mesh Infrastructure Status Update

## Current Mesh-Wide Status (2025-09-07)

### Network Overview
- **Total Nodes**: 3 planned
- **Deployed**: 2/3 operational
- **In Progress**: WSL2 deploying (target: 2025-09-08)

### Phase Status Across All Nodes

#### âœ… Phase 1: Network Foundation (Complete)
- **Hetzner Hub**: 100.84.151.58 - Control node and exit node
- **Fedora Laptop**: 100.84.2.8 - This device, roaming workstation
- **WSL2**: Deploying with userspace networking requirements

#### âœ… Phase 2: Configuration Management (Complete)
- **Control Node**: hetzner-hq operational with Ansible 2.16.3
- **Managed Nodes**: laptop-hq (this device) fully configured
- **Pending**: WSL2 will join as managed node after deployment

#### ðŸš§ Phase 3: File Synchronization (Ready)
- **Status**: Approved and ready to begin
- **Implementation**: Syncthing across all nodes
- **Waiting For**: WSL2 deployment completion
- **Timeline**: Implementation to begin after 2025-09-08

### This Laptop's Current Role

As the **Fedora Laptop** (laptop-hq):
- âœ… **Network**: Connected at 100.84.2.8
- âœ… **Management**: Ansible-managed by hetzner-hq
- âœ… **Services**: Development environment operational
- ðŸ”„ **Preparation**: Ready for Phase 3 file synchronization

### WSL2 Node Considerations

The upcoming WSL2 deployment has special requirements:
- Userspace networking mode (corporate restrictions)
- Limited sudo access (work PC constraints)
- Tailscale userspace networking required

This affects Phase 3 planning as WSL2 will have different capabilities.

### Mesh Infrastructure Maturity

#### Operational Capabilities
- **Network Mesh**: Stable Tailscale overlay
- **Configuration Management**: Automated via Ansible
- **Emergency Access**: Multiple fallback methods documented
- **Security**: SSH key auth, firewall rules, audit trails

#### Development Environment
This laptop provides to the mesh:
- 16-core development workstation
- AI agent hosting (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini)
- Build and test runner capabilities
- Roaming connectivity across networks

#### Next Evolution
With Phase 3 implementation:
- Cross-node file synchronization
- Shared development environments
- Distributed backup strategies
- Enhanced observability

## Integration Status

### With mesh-infra Repository
- Listed in Ansible inventory as operational managed node
- Participates in GitOps workflow for configuration
- Reports status and receives updates automatically

### With Control Node (hetzner-hq)
- SSH key authorized for management access
- Receives baseline and development tool configurations
- Part of `workstations` group for specialized deployments

### With Future WSL2 Node
- Will participate in 3-node file synchronization
- Provides development resources to Windows-constrained environment
- Serves as backup for development tasks when WSL2 has limitations

---

**Status Summary**: This laptop is fully operational and ready for Phase 3 implementation once the mesh reaches full 3-node deployment.
